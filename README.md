# Liao-Ning-Datasets
Liao-Ning-Datasets is two high/multispectral datasets acquired by the ZY1-02D (ZY1-02D) satellite, including the Liao-Ning 01 (LN01) and Liao-Ning 02 (LN02), and the supporting Ground Class reference validation images (Ground Truth) prepared through field investigation.

## Dataset description:

Liao-Ning 01 (LN01) covers the northwest of Jinpu New District, Dalian City, Liaoning Province. The central coordinates are 39.98N, 121.49E. The miniature inland sea, formed by the border between seawater and inland, has complex terrain and diverse types of surface objects, which is suitable for testing classification and fusion tasks. The specific situation is shown in Figure 1.
